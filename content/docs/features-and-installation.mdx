description: Learn about the main capabilities of React Picture Selector and how to install it in your project.
---

React Picture Selector provides a complete solution for handling image uploads with a modern and responsive interface. It supports both drag-and-drop and traditional selection methods, offering real-time progress indication through a smooth progress ring or percentage display. Animations are optimized with `requestAnimationFrame`, ensuring fluid transitions and minimal CPU consumption even on lower-end devices. Upload operations can be safely canceled using the built-in `AbortController`, providing users with full control over the process.
